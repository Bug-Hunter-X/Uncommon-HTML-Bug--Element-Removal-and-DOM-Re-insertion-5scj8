This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to element removal from the DOM.  The `myFunction` removes a div element using `style.display = "none";` but doesn't add it back to the DOM. This creates problems if you later try to access or modify the div element. The solution demonstrates the correct way to handle element removal and re-insertion, ensuring consistent behavior.
